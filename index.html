            <h2>Nebulae</h2>
            <p>
                Nebulae are clouds of dust and gas in outer space. 
                Some nebulae form from gas & dust thrown out by a dying star's explosion.
                 Nebulae can be <a class="bold">star nurseries</a> where new stars begin to form.
                  <br> Nebulae exist in <a class="bold">interstellar</a> space (the space between stars). 
                  The closest nebula to Earth is the <a class="bold">Helix Nebula</a>, a remnant of a dying star.
                  It is <a class="bold">700</a> light years away.

            <h2>Protostar</h2>
            <p>
               Protostars are formed when a cloud of gas in a nebula collapses in on itself due to gravitational attraction. 
               This will result in an internal core. 
               The protostar stage lasts for <a class="bold">500,000</a> years in a <a class="bold">low mass star</a>.
               In the protostar phase, the star is still gathering mass.

            <h2>Main sequence star</h2>
            <p>
                When the gas surrounding a protostar is depleted, it forms a <a class="bold">main sequence star</a>.
                This is any star that is using nuclear fusion to turn hydrogen to helium.
                In a star, two protons (helium nuclei) merge to form a singular helium nucleus. 
                This releases heat and therefore energy. 
                The energy released creates pressure that pushes against the force of the star's gravity, creating a <a class="bold">hydrostatic equilibrium</a>.
                These stars make up around <a class="bold">90%</a> of the universe's population.

            <h2>Red Giant</h2>
            <p>
                When a main sequence star with <a class="bold">< 6 solar masses</a> runs out of hydrogen in its core,
                 it starts to collapse in on itself, as there is more gravitational potential energy than nuclear fusion energy. 
                As it collapses in on itself, the helium starts to fuse into carbon, releasing more energy.
                Then, the fusion of hydrogen begins moving into the star's outer layers, causing them to expand.
                A long time after this, the red giant cannot contain the mass in its outer layers and it gets blow away and forms into a <a class="bold">planetary nebula</a>.

            <h2>White Dwarf</h2>
            <p>
                A white dwarf is what is left after all of the shedding of the outer layers. 
                It is incredibly dense, and produces no heat of its own.
                This means that over billions of year it cools down.
                However, white dwarfs are not just <a class="highlight-white">white</a>, they can be any colour from <a class="highlight-blue">blue</a> to <a class="highlight-red">red</a>.
                White dwarfs are too dim to be seen with the unaided eye.

            <p>
                A black dwarf is a white dwarf that has cooled enough to no longer emit enough heat or light to be visible to the naked eye.
                No <a class="bold">true</a> black dwarfs are expected to exist in the universe, as the time it takes for a white dwarf to reach black dwarf state is longer than the current age of the universe (13.8 billion years).

                A massive star is any star with a mass of <a class="bold">over 6</a> solar masses.
                These stars can produce the elements up to <a class="bold">Iron</a>.
                In addition, these stars are the brightest in the solar system, which can range from <a class="highlight-blue">blue</a> to <a class="highlight-white">white</a>.

            <h2>Red Super Giant</h2>
            <p>
                The process which forms <a class="bold">red supergiants</a> is much the same as the process which forms red giants.
                The only different is simply that red supergiants are much larger. 
                This means that they lose more material quicker and therefore cooled down quicker.
                The red supergiant will eventually run out of hydrogen to fuse.
                The process which causes a red giant to form carbon happens multiple times, with each shrink and expand cycle losing more and more material.
                The elements go from <br> <a class="highlight-white">carbon</a> -> <a class="highlight-orange">neon</a> -> <a class="highlight-skyblue">oxygen</a> -> <a class="highlight-darkgrey">silicon</a> -> <a class="highlight-irongrey">iron</a> <br>
                The star cannot produce any element heavier than that of iron as it would <a class="bold">require energy input</a>, whereas all reaction before this point release energy.

            <h2>Supernova & Neutron Star</h2>
            <p>
                Once a star has depleted all of its fusable materials, the core collapses and then creates a shockwave as it rebounds to its original size. 
                All of the outer layers are expelled in an explosion.
                This explosion is called a supernova.
                The remaining core is a highly dense neutron star.

            <p>
                Magnetars are different to pulsars as their rotation is much slower (<a class="bold">every two to ten seconds</a>).
                In addition, they have extremely strong magnetic fields, up to 1000x stronger than a typical neutron star.

            <h2>Black Holes</h2>
            <p>
                Whilst not technically a type of neutron star, they can also form from neutron stars of red giants. 
                When a star is <a class="bold">over 20 solar masses</a>, instead of a neutron star, a black hole is formed. 
                Black holes have a density so great that nothing. not even light, can escape. 
                The gravitational attraction is simply too concentrated.
